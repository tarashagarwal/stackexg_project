The Projects does the following:

1. Extracts from stackoverflow.com the 10 newest Android-related questions, as well as the 10 most voted Android-related questions that are created in the past week.

2. Builds a simple website that displays the titles of the extracted questions.

3. Provides a convenient way of displaying the full question thread after I click on one of the titles.

4. Adds a cool feature that I came up with myself (will explain this feature in my documentation).
